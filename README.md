# Konfesso-app

I have made this community confession posting app called "Konfesso" which allows users to post their confessions anonymously, the web app has strong authentication done using 
passport.js's google oauth 2.0 strategy, the web app is backed by node.js and database used is mongoDB with mongoose used to make the code easier to understand and a lot shorter.
To prevent redundancy of code, I have used ejs templating in front-end, css and bootstrap are used for making the design professional and the code shorter.
